In this lab, I learned the basics of Python scripting, including how to set up a virtual environment and work with key modules such as os for managing directories, requests for downloading files from the internet, shutil for cleaning up directories, and datetime for adding timestamps. I practiced file handling by creating, writing to, and reading files, allowing me to organize and manage data efficiently. Additionally, I gained experience in using user input to make the script interactive, and I automated tasks like file downloading, modification, and verification, which are essential skills for building dynamic Python applications.
